  readingText01: 
"Everyone has heard of addictions to drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, and even gambling. But can people become addicted to television? If so, how can an addiction to television damage a person's life?\n\n" +
"It's very easy to understand how an addiction to cigarettes, drugs, or alcohol can be very damaging to a person's life. Cigarettes can cause illnesses like cancer and emphysema, a lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. In addition to being bad for your health, alcohol and drugs can impair your ability to think clearly and behave responsibly. These substances can cause your life to slowly fall apart. In the worst cases, alcohol and drug addicts can lose their friends, families, jobs, and homes.\n\n" +
"But how can watching too much television be harmful to your life and health? One way is that it can start a cycle of bad feelings. According to one study, people who watch the most TV already suffer from anxiety or loneliness. Watching TV makes them feel relaxed and helps them forget about their feelings for a while. But the study found that while people did relax while watching television, the feelings of relaxation disappeared after they stopped watching, and the people felt worse than they did when they started watching TV. Therefore, they wanted to watch more television so they could continue to forget their bad feelings. All this TV watching kept them from doing things that could actually make them feel better, like exercising, participating in hobbies, reading, or spending time with friends and family.\n\n" +
"Another way TV watching can be harmful is, like the addictions mentioned above, TV can cause you to neglect your life. The more you watch, the more you want to watch, and after a while, TV replaces real experiences. TV addicts stop talking to their families, don't exercise, don't see their friends, and don't learn new things. Basically, TV addicts stop experiencing life.\n\n" +
"The harmful effects of TV addiction may not be as obvious as those of cigarette, drug, or alcohol addiction, but TV addiction can take a person's life away. If you think that excessive TV watching is not harmful, keep track of how much TV you watch every day, and think about all the other things you could be doing during those wasted hours.",    readingTextTitle02: "Your digital footprint",
    readingText02: 
"Every time you go online, you leave a trail. This is just like a real footprint. It reveals where you've been, how long you stayed, and what you've been doing there. Every time you register for an online service, send an email, download a video, or upload a photo, the information can be accessed and your digital footprint can be revealed. This shouldn't necessarily be worrying, but it is advisable to be aware of your digital footprint and to be cautious and sensible when you are online.\n\nSix Top Tips for Taking Care of Your Digital Footprint\n\n1. Don't forget to log off when you leave a website, especially if you are using a shared computer. If you don't, someone can easily pretend to be you!\n\n2. Don't tell anyone your passwords and don't write them down in an obvious place. Make them more complex by using a combination of letters, numbers, and punctuation marks.\n\n3. Tell an adult if you come across anything online that makes you upset, anxious, or concerned. There are ways to report inappropriate or abusive content, and in most cases, web managers respond rapidly.\n\n4. Remember your favorite websites by using the history button and the bookmark function on your computer or mobile device. This is a way that your digital footprint can work in your favor, but remember to clear your browser history regularly.\n\n5. If you want to post comments online, you don't have to use your own name. Invent a nickname to use instead. You can also use a picture instead of a real photo.\n\n6. Protect your identity online. Be careful about who you share personal information with and always think twice before sharing details like your email, home address, school, or phone number with someone.\n\nThink About the Future\n\nAll kinds of people are interested in your digital footprint. It's now quite common for colleges, universities, and employers to check out the online profiles of possible candidates as part of their application process. There are cases of people having missed out on jobs and places in college because their digital footprint didn't impress the recruiters. So, remember: keep safe, don't put too much personal information online, and always think carefully before you post something. Ask yourself, 'Would I be happy for absolutely everyone to see this?'",    questions: [
